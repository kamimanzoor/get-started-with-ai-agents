Python coding conventions and guidelines

- Use PEP8 style for formatting and naming.
- Prefer snake_case for variables and functions.
- Use docstrings for all public modules, classes, and functions.
- Avoid global variables; prefer function arguments and return values.
- Use type hints for function signatures when possible.
- Prefer list comprehensions and generator expressions for concise code.
- Handle exceptions explicitly; avoid bare excepts.
- Use logging instead of print for production code.
- Write unit tests for all modules and functions.
- Organize code into packages and modules for maintainability.
- Avoid circular imports by careful module design.
- Use virtual environments for dependency management.
- Document dependencies in requirements.txt or pyproject.toml.
- Prefer pathlib for filesystem paths over os.path.
- Use f-strings for string formatting.
- Avoid hardcoding configuration; use environment variables or config files.
- Follow best practices for security (input validation, secrets management).
- Use context managers for resource management (files, network connections).
- Keep functions small and focused; avoid long functions.
- Refactor duplicated code into reusable functions or classes.
